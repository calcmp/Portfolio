            It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by
            the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point
            of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal
            distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content
            here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing
            packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default
            model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web
            sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the
            years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour
            and the like).

              <h3>University module - Responsive Website</h3>
              <p>
                As part of a module in university. My first experience at
                creating a responsive website.

              <h3>Todo ReactJS</h3>
              <p>
                I then went on to getting myself involved in learning a
                framework. The result of my first project - a Todo List created
                in ReactJS (not completely styled, as you may have noticed; I
                hope). After learning the basics I quickly moved on.

              <h3>TDEE ReactJS</h3>
              <p>
                Something more meaningful to me is fitness and part of that is
                tracking your calories and TDEE. I present my TDEE Calculator
                created in ReactJS. You can switch between which formula is used
                as well as metric, imperial, gender, weight loss/gain and so on.

              <h3>TDEE React Native</h3>
              <p>
                Wanting to get into mobile app work, I decided to port my
                ReactJS TDEE Calculator across to React Native and release it on
                the google play store.

              <h3>Flashcards</h3>
              <p>
                Another meaningful project to me is the use of flashcards. I
                created a flashcard app in React Native, which utilised local
                storage and redux for state management to allow users to create
                and save as many decks of flashcards as they like.

              <h3>Demoed</h3>
              <p>
                And where we are at now. Demoed is a React Native app targeted
                towards musicians to record and share demos for their song
                projects. Utilising redux for state management. Some of the
                features include; a fully functional media player, record and
                save recordings, rename, delete, add custom tags, filter based
                on tags, share recordings to other apps and many more.
